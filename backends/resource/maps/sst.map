# MapServer map file uses the pound sign (#) to denote the start of a line
# comment--each line that needs to be commented has to be prepended with a "#".
#
# Map files begin with MAP keyword to signify the start of the map object.
# Well, the entire map file is THE map object.  Enclosed between MAP and END
# at the very bottom of this map file, are keyword/value pairs and other
# objects.

  # In addition to vector data (shapefiles are vector data), MapServer supports
  # a host of raster formats.  In GIS world, one of the most common raster
  # formats is GeoTIFF, a TIFF image with geospatial headers.  MapServer also
  # supports JPEG, PNG, GIF, and other common formats.  Other raster formats
  # supported by MapServer include ESRI Arc/Info grid, HDF and HDF-EOS, NetCDF, 
  # Generic raster binaries, OGC Web Map Service (WMS) layers, etc.  Pretty much 
  # any raster format you can think of is probably supported, thanks to the
  # impressive Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL, pronounced "GOODALL"
  # or GOODLE?).  More information on GDAL is available at http://www.gdal.org.
  #
  # MapServer 4.x can read and display bitmapped (like GIFs), RGB/A (true
  # color), and multispectral (images with more than 3 bands, like raw LandSat
  # images) rasters.
